# _Hornvale_::Specification

A semi-formal specification of Hornvale.

Rather than getting bogged down in implementation details immediately, I want to declare this idea [^1] in some kind of coherent, unambiguous fashion. You know, so I can just _write_ what I want instead of having to specify ownership semantics.

## World

The Game World can be modeled as a directed graph **_G_ = (_V_, _E_)** where:

- _V_ is a set of vertices, with each vertex _v_ ∈ _V_ representing a region in the game.
- _E_ is a set of edges, with each edge _e_ ∈ _E_ representing a passage between regions. An edge is an ordered pair (_v_<sub>_i_</sub>, _v_<sub>_j_</sub>) indicating a passage from region _v_<sub>_i_</sub> to region _v_<sub>_j_</sub>.

### World Seed

Each world is generated by a distinct seed value, the **World Seed**, which determines pseudorandom number generation through each of the subsequent layers of the world structure. Specifics of this are implementation details.



## Region




[^1]:  "You can't just say that your game exists."
  "I didn't say it. I _declared_ it."
